# Pinball Pal | Android Development Course Project

## Running the application

If you are my course instructor, I have provided instructions and a valid API Key in my Moodle submission.

If you are someone who is snooping around my GitHub account, you can follow the instructions below:

### Getting an API Key

Visit [this link](https://www.ifpapinball.com/api/request_api_key.php) and fill out the form to request your own API Key.

### Using your API Key with the application

1. Pull down the repo.
2. Open it in your favorite code editor.
3. Navigate to the [pinball_pal/lib/services/ifpa-service.dart](pinball_pal/lib/services/ifpa-service.dart) file.
4. On line 6, change the value of the apiKey variable to your API Key.
5. Now, you should be able to use the app with all of its functionality.
